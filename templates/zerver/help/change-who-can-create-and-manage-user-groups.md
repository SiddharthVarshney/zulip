By default, anyone other than guests can [create and manage user groups](/help/user-groups) to the
organization. However, you can change your organization's settings to only
allow administrators to create and manage user groups.

### Change who can create and manage user groups

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

2. Under **Other permissions**, configure **Who can create and manage user groups**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}
